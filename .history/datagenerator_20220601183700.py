## Multiple functions that help generate random data. Our goal is to simulate data flow similar to a e-commerce site. DAG will be run every hour.

##Purposely making these csv tables disorganized so there is an actual transformation process




# Function that generates a randomized number of orders in the last



def orderbatch():
    # Generate a random number of records
    numberoforders = random.randrange(0,10)
    dic = {}







#Function that generates new users joined in the last hour 
#

def newusers():
        # Generate a random number of records
    numberoforders = random.randrange(0,10)





## Function that generates inventory left
